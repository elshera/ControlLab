# pid_control
The notebook contains several classes of controllers:

* P (Proportional)
* PI (Proportional-Integral
* PD (Proportional-Derivative)
* PID (Proportional-Integrative-Derivative)
* PID Optimal with anti-windup effect
* Open Loop. 

## Description
Execute the notebook code and modifying paramteres of controllers it is possible to see the dependencies of the loop behaviour to the parameters and the necessary trade-offs for tuning paramters and getting optimal loop. The example in the noteboook refers to the altitude control of a quadcopter. 

## Usage
1. Select the desired parameters for simulation in the related section of the Notebook
2. Select the controller class 
3. Run the simulation and plot the results.
