# pid_control
The notebook contains several classes of controllers. P (Proportional), PI (Proportional-Integral, PD (Proportional-Derivative), PID (Proportional-Integrative-Derivative) and Open Loop. 

By executing the notebook code and modifying paramteres of controllers it is possible to see the dependencies of the loop behaviour to the parameters and the necessary trade-offs for tuning paramters and getting optimal loop.

The example in the noteboook refers to the altitude control of a quadcopter.
